# Getting started

## Open a project

Launch Typsastra and choose **Open Project**, or select one of the five recent
projects. **Show All Recent Projects** opens fuzzy search across up to 32 stored
projects. A project is a directory containing ordinary Typst source and assets.

To learn without changing your own files, choose **Open Examples**. Typsastra
installs writable copies in your Documents folder and opens `START-HERE.typ`.

## Choose the main document

Right-click a `.typ` file in Explorer or its editor tab and choose **Set as Main
File**. The action is unavailable for other file types. Included chapters keep
the configured main document's complete preview when opened.

## Edit and preview

Typsastra manages Tinymist, so a separate Typst installation is normally not
required. Choose preview-on-type for immediate feedback or preview-on-save for
large documents and lower background work. PDF compilation is asynchronous;
the workspace UI becomes ready before the first preview finishes.

Use the preview page field to jump to a page. Use **Reveal Cursor in Preview**
or `Alt+Enter` (`Option+Enter` on macOS) for manual forward sync. Double-click
supported preview content for inverse sync.

## Save and export

Save with `Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`. Export a PDF for the current preview target from
the application command. Project export is different: a `.typsastra` archive
packages portable project source and metadata but excludes fonts, caches, and
generated PDFs.

Next: [Projects and main files](PROJECTS_AND_MAIN_FILES.md).
