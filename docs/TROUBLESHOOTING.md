# Troubleshooting

For a workflow-oriented starting point, see the
[tutorial troubleshooting guide](./tutorials/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). This reference
keeps the detailed build, packaging, platform, and diagnostic procedures.

## Native features do not work in the browser

Use:

```bash
bun run tauri dev
```

`bun run dev` starts only Vite in a browser. Native filesystem access, dialogs, settings persistence, Tinymist, and Tauri IPC will not work there.

## Windows build errors

### `LNK1104: cannot open file 'msvcrt.lib'`

Install the Visual Studio **Desktop development with C++** workload and Windows SDK, then restart the terminal.

### MSI packaging fails with `light.exe` or VBSCRIPT errors

Enable **VBSCRIPT** under Windows Optional Features. This is needed only for MSI generation.

## Linux build errors

### `webkit2gtk-4.1` or `javascriptcoregtk-4.1` missing

Install the WebKitGTK 4.1 packages for your distribution. See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

## macOS reports that Typsastra is damaged

The experimental macOS release is intentionally distributed without Apple
Developer ID signing or notarization. Gatekeeper can consequently display
**“Typsastra.app is damaged and can't be opened”** after a browser download
even when the application bundle is intact.

First ensure the app was downloaded from the official Typsastra GitHub release.
Move it to `/Applications`, then remove quarantine from Typsastra only and open
it:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Typsastra.app"
open "/Applications/Typsastra.app"
```

Never disable Gatekeeper globally. If this targeted workaround fails, delete
the app and download it again before reporting the release filename, Mac model,
processor architecture, and macOS version. See the complete safety notes in
[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md#open-an-unsigned-macos-release).

In-app updates are independently protected by mandatory Tauri updater
signatures and normally should not need quarantine removal again. Manually
downloading a newer build through a browser may require repeating the targeted
workaround.

## Shell cannot find `bun` or `cargo`

Restart the terminal and verify that the relevant directories are on `PATH`:

- Bun: `~/.bun/bin`
- Rust: `~/.cargo/bin`

Then verify:

```bash
git --version
rustc --version
cargo --version
bun --version
```

## Tinymist cannot be downloaded

Verify GitHub access and retry from **Settings → Toolchain**. A system `typst` executable does not replace the managed Tinymist requirement.

## Preview or inverse sync problems

Preview behavior is handled by Tinymist and Typsastra's preview iframe layer. Developer notes are in [PREVIEW_INTERCEPTION.md](./PREVIEW_INTERCEPTION.md).

When reporting preview issues, include:

- Operating system.
- Typsastra version.
- Whether the preview is docked or undocked.
- Whether the file is `main.typ` or an included file.
- Any visible messages from the developer log console.

### Linux preview is completely white

If PDF export succeeds but the embedded preview is white or only appears briefly while resizing, open **Settings → Preview → Linux preview compatibility**. Review the detected session, WebKitGTK version, and graphics vendor, then enable **Disable WebKitGTK DMA-BUF renderer** and restart Typsastra.

The equivalent temporary launch workaround is:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 typsastra
```

For an AppImage:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 ./Typsastra_0.5.1_amd64.AppImage
```

This is a WebKitGTK rendering workaround. It does not change Typst compilation or the exported PDF and may reduce rendering performance. When reporting the issue, also include `echo "$XDG_SESSION_TYPE"` and the installed `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0` version where available.
